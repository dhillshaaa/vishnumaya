        <h1>For Mr. Rashidh..</h1>
        <p>
           As and always your girl loves you more than anything in this world she doesn't know from when it is maybe from the moment you told that your wife know to write and tell stories well ,the moment she belongs to you she being someone's only choice, priority,need,greed, anything that means being someone's only property forever and ever that means a lot to her it's her pride that I am his wife ,girl,even headache and personal appointed torture but any position in his life with pleasure to be his and only his . There are up's and downs,flaws ,mistakes selfishness that too to be with him or the space needed as every typical clingy lover girl who waited for years to express this love and emotions to that one man who returned me what I gave a million times in return, that's the point where at the end of the day whatever the fight, misunderstandings, miscommunication happens it has to be sorted with its okay let's see you sleep well now good night and love you with a heart full of heavy thoughts and a one line miss you fillss is unexplainable to anyone at any point even he maybe can't feel it as he is the treasure I found so these thoughts remains in the founder as and always in the same way.
    With lots of love and hugs from your wife .
Now I'm missing the word wife everywhere I am dying hard to be your wife one day , some day whenever waiting for that day not in a rush but before I could die wanna be called and told to everyone that I'm your wife.<br><br>
            I am so lucky to call you mine.  
            Forever and always 💗
